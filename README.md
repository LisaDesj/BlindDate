# BlindDate

For Tiger from Lisa:

- trialDB.csv is a sample database and feel free to add or change it (but it must be formated the way it is) (Also best if the answers have only a few choices)
- we will need more wants added but it was a lot of work for me to write this already.

Columns: name,age,sex,orientation,bodytype,education,height,offspring,wAge,wSex,wKids

Orientation: 'straight', 'gay', 'bisexual'
Body type: 'thin', 'average', 'athletic', 'a little extra'
Education: 'high school', 'some college', 'college'
Height: in inches
Offspring: 'has kid(s)', 'no kids'
Ethnicity: if more than one race choose 'mixed'
wSex (wants Sex): 'M', 'F', or 'B' (both)
wKids (wants future kids): 'yes', 'no', 'maybe'

(also concerned about how read_profile will manage a larger database).
