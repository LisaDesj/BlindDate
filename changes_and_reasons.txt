program doesn save profile unless user is ready for match
  becuase the program always begins by asking profile information,
  so if the profile is already created, it's redundent

program now verifies inputs
  so the user doesn't have to start from the beginning after one invalid input

using double quotation for strings
  single quotation is treated a atom rather a list of char
  to avoid unexpected behaviour

User will state state preference by giving an ordered list 
example #1: [Sex, Kids, Loc, Age]
example #2: [Loc, Age, Sex, Kids]

match will return top 10 results, with the options to view each profile

when view a profile, there is an option is return back to the top two options page to choose again
